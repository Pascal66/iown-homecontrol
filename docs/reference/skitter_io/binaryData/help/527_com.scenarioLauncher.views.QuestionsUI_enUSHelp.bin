<question title="I can't launch the end-products storage process">Connect a Skitter to your computer, then click on "add products". Make sure your end-products are powered on.</question>
<question title="New end-products are not displayed">Make sure your end-products are powered on. Exit Skit’Easy then restart it. Click on the "My installation" tab, then on the "add products" button. </question>
<question title="I can't retrieve end-products already stored in a remote control transmitter (without Skitter)">Make sure the remote control transmitter correctly controls the products you want to add to the "My installation" menu. Then determine whether your remote control transmitter has feedback function (logo "2" with a double arrow) or does not have feedback function (logo "1" with a single arrow). Next follow the installation procedure by clicking on "add products" in the "My installation" tab.</question>
<question title="The application no longer asks me the question: &quot;Do you have a remote control transmitter with feedback function?&quot;">Your Skit’Easy interface has already stored the end-products, and has retrieved their security key. It may be that certain end-products in your home have a different security key. You must call on a professional in order to store these end-products in your Skitter Easy interface. If you are a professional, you will find the password in the instructions for Skitter "installers". </question>
