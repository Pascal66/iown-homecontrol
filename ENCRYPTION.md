All products and applications integrated into the system not only communicate with the remote control, but also with each other. io-homecontrol® is based on radio communication and works in the frequency range from 868 to 870 megahertz. 
Before the sender and receiver communicate with each other, the availability of the channel is checked. 
If a bandwidth is overloaded or occupied, the application waits for the frequency to become free before communicating (Listen before Talk) or switches to one of the other channels (Adaptive Frequency Agility). io-homecontrol® thus complies with the applicable European radio technology standard EN 300220. 
These properties ensure that every command given arrives at the product and is executed. io-homecontrol® has a range of around 20 meters and penetrates walls and furnishings. 
When used for the first time, the remote control (transmitter) and product (receiver) exchange a 128-bit encryption code and combine it with a random number for each new action. 
A code is calculated from this, which the transmitter and receiver compare with each other. 
The product only reacts to the required action if they match. This safety mechanism prevents you from reacting to an external transmitter. The new application automatically searches for existing products and takes them into account in its promotions.
